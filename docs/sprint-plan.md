# Sprint Planning: Travel Memory Journal

## Overall Strategy
**MVP Goal**: Help travelers capture, organize, and easily recall travel memories with minimal effort  
**Technical Foundation**: Python CLI with local JSON storage, Pydantic validation, and rule-based tag extraction  
**User Journey**: From first memory capture in <5 minutes to rich memory collection with intelligent tagging and discovery

## Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Workflow (2 weeks)
**Sprint Goal**: Users can capture and retrieve their first travel memory end-to-end

**Jobs to be Done**:
- As a traveler, I can quickly add a memory with location, date, and description
- As a traveler, I can view all my memories in a chronological list  
- As a developer, I have a solid foundation with data models and storage
- As a business, I can demonstrate core value proposition of effortless memory capture

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Core data models (Memory, MemoryCollection) with Pydantic validation
- [ ] Local JSON storage with atomic file operations and basic backup
- [ ] CLI foundation using Typer with `add-memory` and `list-memories` commands
- [ ] Interactive mode for guided memory creation (new user experience)
- [ ] Quick mode for experienced users with command-line flags
- [ ] In-memory caching with load-once strategy for fast operations
- [ ] Basic error handling with clear user feedback
- [ ] Project setup with uv, pyproject.toml, and development workflow
- [ ] Simple test coverage for core functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can add first memory within 5 minutes of installation
- Memory addition takes less than 30 seconds
- App launches in under 3 seconds with data loading
- All memories persist reliably in local JSON storage

## Sprint 2: Enhanced Functionality (2 weeks)
**Sprint Goal**: Users have intelligent tag extraction and memory discovery capabilities

**Jobs to be Done**:
- As a traveler, I can automatically extract meaningful tags from my memory descriptions
- As a traveler, I can find my "top memory" (most tagged experience)
- As a traveler, I can search and filter my memory collection
- As a business, I can demonstrate advanced memory organization features
- As a developer, I can monitor system performance and data integrity

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Rule-based NLP engine for automatic tag extraction from descriptions
- [ ] Travel-specific keyword dictionaries (activities, food, culture, transport, emotions)
- [ ] `process-memory` command for extracting tags from natural language
- [ ] `top-memory` command to identify memory with most tags
- [ ] `search-memories` and `show-memory` commands for memory discovery
- [ ] Enhanced CLI with progress indicators and rich formatting
- [ ] Memory analytics and statistics functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation and error recovery
- [ ] Performance monitoring for search operations (<2s requirement)
- [ ] Extended test suite with edge case coverage

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Tag extraction processes memory descriptions in under 30 seconds
- Search operations return results in under 2 seconds
- Tag extraction accuracy meets user expectations for travel content
- Users can easily discover and revisit past memories

## Sprint 3: Scale & Polish (2 weeks)  
**Sprint Goal**: Production-ready system with excellent user experience and reliability

**Jobs to be Done**:
- As a traveler, I have a polished, responsive experience with helpful guidance
- As a traveler, I can confidently use the system without fear of data loss
- As a business, I can scale to power users with large memory collections
- As a developer, I can maintain and extend the system with confidence

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Advanced error handling with automatic backup recovery
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets (1000+ memories)
- [ ] Rich CLI experience with consistent visual design and emoji indicators
- [ ] Comprehensive help system with examples and command discovery
- [ ] Data validation and integrity checks on startup
- [ ] Automated backup strategy with timestamped files
- [ ] Memory import/export functionality for data portability
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and load testing
- [ ] Documentation for users and developers
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and quality checks
- [ ] Distribution packaging for easy installation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System handles 1000+ memories efficiently with sub-second operations
- Users never lose data due to file corruption or system errors  
- CLI provides intuitive, discoverable interface for all user skill levels
- System is ready for broader user adoption with reliable operation

## Key Success Metrics
- **Sprint 1**: First memory added within 5 minutes, basic CRUD operations working
- **Sprint 2**: Tag extraction working, users can find and rediscover memories  
- **Sprint 3**: System handles scale, excellent user experience, production-ready

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Simple JSON storage may not scale → Monitor performance, plan SQLite migration path
- **User Adoption Risk**: CLI complexity → Focus on intuitive commands and excellent help system
- **Data Loss Risk**: File corruption → Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Timeline Risk**: Feature creep → Strict adherence to MVP scope, defer advanced features

Focus on delivering complete user value in each sprint, with each increment building toward the full travel memory management experience.
