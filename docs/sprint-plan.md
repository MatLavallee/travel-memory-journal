**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Search operations return results in under 2 seconds
- Users can find any memory within 3 commands maximum  
- Tag management operations are intuitive and reversible
- Memory editing preserves data integrity and history
- System handles 100+ memories efficiently

## Sprint 3: Production Ready & Scale (2 weeks) - **UPDATED SCOPE**
**Sprint Goal**: Production-ready system with excellent user experience and enterprise-level reliability

**Jobs to be Done**:
- ~~As a traveler, I have a polished, responsive experience with helpful guidance~~ ✅ **LARGELY COMPLETED in Sprint 1**
- As a traveler, I can confidently use the system without fear of data loss
- As a business, I can scale to power users with large memory collections (1000+ memories)
- As a developer, I can maintain and extend the system with confidence
- As a business, I can distribute the system to users easily

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Advanced error handling with automatic backup recovery and corruption detection
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets (1000+ memories)
- ~~[ ] Rich CLI experience with consistent visual design and emoji indicators~~ ✅ **COMPLETED in Sprint 1**
- [ ] Comprehensive help system with examples and command discovery
- [ ] Data validation and integrity checks on startup
- ~~[ ] Automated backup strategy with timestamped files~~ ✅ **COMPLETED in Sprint 1**

## Key Success Metrics
- **Sprint 1**: ✅ **EXCEEDED** - First memory added within 5 minutes, basic CRUD operations working, PLUS advanced tag extraction and rich CLI delivered early
- **Sprint 2**: Enhanced search and discovery, memory management, system handles 100+ memories efficiently
- **Sprint 3**: Production-ready system handles 1000+ memories, enterprise reliability, easy distribution

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Simple JSON storage may not scale → Monitor performance, plan SQLite migration path
- **User Adoption Risk**: CLI complexity → Focus on intuitive commands and excellent help system
- **Data Loss Risk**: File corruption → Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Timeline Risk**: Feature creep → Strict adherence to MVP scope, defer advanced features

Focus on delivering complete user value in each sprint, with each increment building toward the full travel memory management experience.
