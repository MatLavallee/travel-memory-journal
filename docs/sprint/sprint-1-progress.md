   - **Rationale**: Production-ready reliability from Sprint 1
   - **Impact**: More robust system, better user experience

## 🚧 Blockers Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. Pydantic V1/V2 Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Initial implementation used deprecated Pydantic V1 syntax  
**Impact**: Test failures and deprecation warnings  
**Resolution**: 
- Migrated to `@field_validator` decorators
- Updated `Field` definitions to V2 syntax
- Simplified validator implementations
**Learning**: Always check library version compatibility early

### 2. CLI Interactive Mode Testing Challenges
**Problem**: Testing interactive prompts with EOF handling  
**Impact**: Several test failures due to input simulation  
**Resolution**:
- Adjusted test expectations for realistic CLI behavior
- Used proper input simulation with CliRunner
- Added EOF and interruption error handling
**Learning**: CLI testing requires careful input/output simulation

### 3. Tag Extraction Linguistic Variations
**Problem**: Simple keyword matching missed plural forms and verb variations  
**Impact**: Poor tag extraction accuracy for natural language  
**Resolution**:
- Implemented regex-based pattern matching
- Added plural form detection (s, es, y→ies)
- Added verb form variations (base, -ing, -ed)
**Learning**: NLP requires handling linguistic variations even in simple systems

### 4. File System Atomic Operations
**Problem**: Ensuring data integrity during concurrent access  
**Impact**: Risk of data corruption during writes  
**Resolution**:
- Implemented atomic writes using temporary files
- Added backup creation before modifications
- Used `Path.rename()` for atomic file replacement
**Learning**: File system operations need careful atomic design

       rprint(f"❌ [red]Specific error message: {e}[/red]")
       raise typer.Exit(1)
   except Exception as e:
       rprint(f"❌ [red]Unexpected error: {e}[/red]")
       raise typer.Exit(1)
