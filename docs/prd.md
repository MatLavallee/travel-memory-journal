- **Desired outcome**: Effortless memory capture with easy recall and browsing

## Solution Requirements

### Core User Stories (prioritized)
1. **As a traveler, I want to quickly add a memory** so that I can capture experiences without interrupting my travel flow
   - Acceptance: Can add memory in < 30 seconds
   - Must include: location, date, description
   - Optional: tags, photos

2. **As a traveler, I want my memories to persist** so that I never lose my experiences
   - Acceptance: Local storage with data integrity
   - No cloud dependencies

3. As a traveler, I want to have a command that, where I can dictate or write a big, large description of my experience and get a JSON respond with all the relevant tags, as the example you can see. 

```
Input:
# Memory:
Today I visited Paris, I went to a restaurant, had a coffee, some good wine from Beaujolais, and I visited the Louvre, I saw the Mona Lisa, and then I went to the mountain, did some skiing and some shopping at the local market. 

Output:
{
    "food": ["restaurant", "coffee", "wine", "beaujolais"],
    "culture": ["louvres", ..],
    ...
}
```

4. I want to be able to look at all my past experiences and identify the top memory. Let's say for this case that the top memory is the one who has the most tags. 

### Success Criteria
- **Primary Metrics**: 
  - Daily/Weekly Active Users (retention)
  - Number of memories added per user per week
  - Session frequency (how often users return)
  
- **Leading Indicators**:
  - First memory added within 5 minutes of app launch
  - Multiple memories added in first session

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: 
  - App launch < 3 seconds
  - Memory search results < 2 seconds
  - UI interactions feel responsive (< 100ms)
  
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ memories per user efficiently
- **Security**: Local-only storage, no external data transmission

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Definition
**Core Features**:
- Add new memory (location, date, description, optional tags)
- View all memories in chronological list
- Local storage
- Simple CLI

**Out of Scope for MVP**:
- Photo attachments
- Advanced filtering/sorting
- Export functionality
- Cloud sync
- Mobile apps
- Social sharing

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Data loss if local storage corrupts
- **Mitigation**: Regular local backups, robust error handling

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Efficient database indexing, pagination for large result sets

## Development Approach
Given the 1-hour constraint, focus on:
1. Core data model and storage
2. Basic CRUD operations for memories
3. Simple list view for browsing
4. Minimal but functional CLI

Success will be measured by whether a user can add their first memory and browse it back within the first 5 minutes of using the app.
