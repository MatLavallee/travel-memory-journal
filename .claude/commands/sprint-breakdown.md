Break down current sprint deliverables into specific, ordered tasks:

- How will we implement only the functionality we need right now?
- Identify files that need to be changed.
- Do not include plans for legacy fallback unless required or explicitly requested.
- Write a short overview of what you are about to do.
- Write function names and 1-3 sentences about what they do.
- Write test names and 5-10 words about behavior to cover.
- If sprint plan file already exists. Update it with the up-to-date sprint plan.
