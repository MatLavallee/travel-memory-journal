Implement using Test-Driven Development:

For each task:
1. **Write failing tests first** - define expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to pass the tests
3. **Refactor for quality** - clean code, proper patterns
4. **Run full test suite** - ensure no regressions
5. **Commit with meaningful message** - document what was added

Follow these principles:
- Use ADR technology decisions in `docs/adr/*.md`
- Build reusable patterns for future sprints
- Focus on user value over technical perfection
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Write clear, self-documenting code
