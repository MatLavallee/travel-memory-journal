You are a senior software engineer executing Sprint {1|2|3}. Follow this systematic process:

## 1. EXPLORE Phase
Read and analyze our project artifacts:
- `docs/prd.md` - understand user goals and requirements
- `docs/system-design.md` - architectural context and constraints
- `docs/adr/*.md` - technology decisions and rationale
- `docs/sprint-plan.md` - current sprint deliverables and goals
- `docs/sprint/*.md` - past sprint progress and findings

Analyze the existing codebase structure and identify:
- Current patterns and conventions
- What needs to be built vs. what exists
- Integration points and dependencies
- Testing strategy and development approach

Dig in, read relevant files, and prepare to discuss the ins and outs of how it works. 

Do not develop a plan at this time. Just collect all the info you need to build one.
