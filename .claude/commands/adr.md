You are a senior technical architect. Based on the decisions identified in `docs/system-design.md`, create Architecture Decision Records for the key choices.

Create ADR files in `docs/adr/` using this template:

# ADR-{NNNN}: {Decision Title}

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: {Today's date}
**Context**: {Brief context from SDD}

## Problem Statement
What specific architectural decision do we need to make and why?

## Decision Drivers
- **Business Requirements**: {From PRD}
- **Technical Constraints**: {From SDD}
- **Team Constraints**: Skills, timeline, resources
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, security

## Options Considered

### Option 1: {Recommended Option}
**Pros**:
- {Key benefits for our use case}
- {Alignment with PRD requirements}

**Cons**:
- {Limitations we accept}
- {Trade-offs we're making}

**Implementation Effort**: {S/M/L/XL}
**Operational Complexity**: {Low/Medium/High}

### Option 2: {Alternative}
**Pros**: {Benefits}
**Cons**: {Drawbacks}
**Why Not Chosen**: {Specific reasons}

### Option 3: {Alternative}
**Pros**: {Benefits}  
**Cons**: {Drawbacks}
**Why Not Chosen**: {Specific reasons}

## Decision
We will use {chosen option}.

**Rationale**: {Why this choice best serves our PRD objectives and technical requirements}

## Consequences
**Positive**:
- {Benefits we expect to realize}
- {Problems this solves from PRD/SDD}

**Negative**:
- {Trade-offs we're accepting}
- {New operational requirements}

**Implementation Notes**:
- {Next steps to implement this decision}
- {Dependencies or prerequisites}

Some examples of ADRs would be critical decisions that relate to:
1. API Framework choice (0001-api-framework.md)
2. Database selection (0002-database.md)  
3. Deployment platform (0003-deployment.md)
4. Authentication strategy (0004-auth-strategy.md)

Recommend options that balance simplicity, performance, and alignment with PRD requirements.
