Create `docs/sprint/sprint-{1|2|3}-progress.md` with:

- **Completed deliverables** and their status
- **Scope changes** or technical decisions made during development
- **Blockers encountered** and how they were resolved
- **Learnings and insights** that impact future sprints
- **Next steps** for next sprint continuation. You will not be working on the next phase so write comprehensive notes so that the next developper who is more junior than you can hit the ground running
- **Update overall plan** in `docs/sprint-plan.md` accordingly.
